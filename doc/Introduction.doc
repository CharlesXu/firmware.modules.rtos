/**
 * \page Introduction Short Introduction to OpenSEK
 *
 * In this page you will find only a short introduction to the project. It
 * is a good start point. After reading it you may want to continue reading
 * the rest of the documentation separated in many doxygen pages.
 *
 * \section Introduction_About About OpenSEK
 *
 * OpenSEK is an Open Source implementation released under the terms of GPL of
 * the RTOS specified by OSEK-VDX. You can get the OSEK-VDX specification under
 * http://www.osek-vdx.org/.
 *
 * \section Introduction_Why Why OpenSEK?
 *
 * The project started as an idea many years ago. At that moment (2005) I
 * had only few knowledge of embedded systems and no idea how to create a
 * code generator which is an indispensable part for an OSEK implementation.
 *
 * First in Juli 2008 I had the idea to use php as generator and I started
 * programming the first OpenSEK version which was available in September 2008
 * for posix arhcitectures simulating the needed hardware of an embedded
 * system.
 *
 * At this moment OpenSEK is still under development. The goals of OpenSEK
 * is to be used for educational propuses or as demostrator.
 *
 * OpenSEK is not designed to be used on a real car and or any
 * other application where human lives were under risk. Take into account that
 * OpenSEK is released under the terms of GPL. OpenSEK Team will not
 * take ANY responsability of what you do with this software and what it may
 * happens. Please refer you to the GPL License for more information.
 *
 * \section Introduction_System What do I need to run OpenSEK?
 *
 * To generate the system and to run it you will need:
 *
 *  - php version 5.2.x (for the generation)
 *  - make
 *  - gcc
 *
 * There are some other tools that you are going to need to take advantage of
 * some extra features:
 *
 *  - SVN if you want to check it out from SVN server.
 *  - splint if you want to check the code
 *  - doxygen to generate the documentation
 *  - gcov to maeasure the test coverage
 *  - perl to run documentation scripts
 *  - nm to get the RAM/ROM consumption
 *
 * \section Introduction_Installing Installing OpenSEK
 *
 * You can download OpenSEK from the project page in SourceForge.net:
 *
 *  - https://sourceforge.net/projects/opensek/
 *
 * or you can get the trunk from SVN
 *
 *  - http://opensek.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/opensek/trunk/
 *
 * \section Introduction_Compiling Compiling OpenSEK for the first time
 *
 * If this is your fist time with using OpenSEK we recomend you to download
 * the last version from sourceforge.
 *
 * First of all you have to decompress the package:
 *
 *  - tar -xzf OpenSEK_release_vx_x_x_YYYYMMDD_name
 *  - cd OpenSEK_release_vx_x_x_YYYYMMDD_name
 *
 * After this you have to configure the architecture in which you want to
 * compule the software. Edit the Makefile on the root directory and set
 * the make variable ARCH to the arh that you want to compile for.
 *
 * ARCH = posix
 *
 * in the comment before the ARCH declaration you shall find a list of all
 * supported architectures.
 *
 * After selecting the right architecture you can execute the followings
 * commands:
 *
 *  - make generate
 *  - make
 *  - make doc (only to generate the documentation)
 *  - ./out/bin/OpenSEK
 *
 * If you dont change the original makefile you will generate and compile the
 * module test. If you execute the executable after compiling it you are
 * going to see the test cases and OK, FAILED or NOTRUN on the display.
 * If one or more of the test cases results are other than OK you are
 * having problems, the code system is not running correctly.
 *
 * \section Introduction_FirstProject Compiling your first OpenSEK project
 *
 * If you run the moduletests01 without problems you can try to run the
 * example01 and base your project on this example.
 *
 * The example today is almost empty, one task planed for the next release is
 * to provide a good and well documented example.
