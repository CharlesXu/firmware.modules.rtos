/** \page OilFormat Oil File Format and Configuration Documentation
 *
 * \section OilFormat_Configuration Configuration
 *
 * As you know the FreeOSEK is a static configured operating system. For example the count
 * and types of task is defined at generation time. For that you have to write your own
 * configuration in oil format. The example01 contains a configuration under
 * example01/etc/example01.oil. If you need more information about the oil format take a
 * look on the OSEK-VDX page: http://www.osek-vdx.org
 *
 * Take into account that the oil format used on FreeOSEK is still under development and
 * is in pre beta release, so do not surprise you if many thinks are not working as you want.
 *
 * \section OilFormat_Generation Generation
 *
 * After you have wrote your configuration you can generate your osek for that you have to run:
 *
 * make generate.
 *
 * The generator is a program who parse the oil file and generate the configuration for
 * the operating system in function from what you need, for example count of tasks, name
 * of the events, priority etc etc etc.
 *
 * The generator is written in php and the files to be generated too.
 *
 * \subsection OilFormat_Genration_Internal Generation Structure
 *
 * For the generation the Makefile calls the script generator.php, this script has to be
 * called with some options that you can see editing the file.
 *
 * The generator file will call the config.php script to load the configuration and this
 * one calls the oilparser.php to parse the oilfiles given as input.
 *
 * The files to be generated are given as parameter too.
 *
 * If you want to write your file to be generated is easy, take as example some of the
 * OpenOSEK/etc/src/\* to start.
 *
 * The generation process has to be optimized but is working.
 * Dependencis to each architecture
 *
 * At the moment FreeOSEK is only available for POSIX.
