 * 0. What is OpenSEK?
 *
 *		OpenSEK is an OpenSource implementation of the the RTOS
 *		specified by OSEK-VDX. You can download the OSEK-VDX specification
 *		from http://www.osek-vdx.org/.
 *
 * 1. What do I need to use OpenSEK?
 * 
 *		OpenSEK is developed and tested in Linux but it can be generated
 *		and used in others architectures. At the moment OpenSEK only runs
 *		in POSIX architectures, no embedded system.
 *
 *			To generate OpenSEK you will need:
 *
 *				- php 5.2.1
 *
 *			To compile OpenSEK you will need:
 *
 *				- gcc 4.1.2
 *	
 *	2. How to compile and run the demo?
 *	
 *		from the root directory execute:
 * \code
 * make clean
 * make generate
 * make
 * ./bin/OpenSEK
 * \endcode
 *		
 *		and if you want to generate the doxygen documentation
 *
 * \code
 * make doc
 * \endcode
 *
 *	3. How to port OpenSEK to an other architecture?
 *
 *		First of all we will finish the first version of OpenSEK for posix
 *		system. After that we will start porting OpenSEK to at least one
 *		microcontroller. If you want to participate please contact us.
 *
 *	4. To be involved
 *
 *		Do you want to participate on the development of OpenSEK,
 *		please contact me at mcerdeiro@gmail.com.
