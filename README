 * 0. Give us Feedback.
 *
 *		We are interested in your feedback. If you have downloaded FreeOSEK
 *		please tell you us your opinion, we know we are still working on it
 *		but we would like to know which features/architectures/boards and etc.
 *		are you	interested for. Any compent good or not can be helpfull for
 *		us. We wait for your opinion on http://opensek.sf.net/forum-op.html
 * 
 * 1. What is FreeOSEK?
 *
 *		FreeOSEK is an OpenSource implementation of the the RTOS
 *		specified by OSEK-VDX. You can download the OSEK-VDX specification
 *		from http://www.osek-vdx.org/.
 *
 * 2. What do I need to use FreeOSEK?
 * 
 *		FreeOSEK is developed and tested in Linux but it can be generated
 *		and used in others architectures. At the moment FreeOSEK only runs
 *		in POSIX architectures, no embedded system.
 *
 *			To generate FreeOSEK you will need:
 *
 *				- php 5.2.1
 *
 *			To compile FreeOSEK you will need:
 *
 *				- gcc 4.1.2
 *
 *			To generate the documentation you will need:
 *
 *				- perl
 *				- nm
 *				- doxygen
 *	
 *	3. How to compile and run the demo?
 *	
 *		from the root directory execute:
 * \code
 * make clean
 * make generate
 * make
 * ./bin/FreeOSEK
 * \endcode
 *		
 *		and if you want to generate the doxygen documentation
 *
 * \code
 * make doc
 * \endcode
 *
 *	4. How to port FreeOSEK to an other architecture?
 *
 *		First of all we will finish the first version of FreeOSEK for posix
 *		system. After that we will start porting FreeOSEK to at least one
 *		microcontroller. If you want to participate please contact us.
 *
 *	5. To get involved
 *
 *		Do you want to participate on the development of FreeOSEK,
 *		please contact me at mcerdeiro@gmail.com.
 *
 *	6. Editting and viewing the source code with the right indentation
 *
 *		Please take into account that the FreeOSEK source code is written
 *		tabs which represent 3 spaces. To see the source code in with the
 *		right indentation please set your tabs to 3 spaces (without
 *		replacing). This topic is still under discussion if you want to
 *		participate leave us your message in the forum.
 *		To do that in vi you can use "set tabstop=3", in other editor
 *		you have to search in the options or preferences.
