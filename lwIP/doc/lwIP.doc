/** \page lwIP FreeOSEK lwIP Manual
 *
 * The TCPIP used in FreeOSEK is the lwIO (Lightweight TCP/IP stack). We only
 * adapt the structure to be like any other FreeOSEK module, to compile
 * in the same make environment and use the same like configuration and
 * to run with or without FreeOSEK OS. Source and Header files are almost
 * the originals, in every file one or more doxygen groups were added
 * to separate the lwip doxygen documentation to a special module called
 * OpenTCPIP.
 *
 * This manual will explain all special configurations and configurations
 * used under FreeOSEK environment but nothing related to the stack selfs.
 * The docuementation of the stack can be found under \b doc_orig folder
 * or in the lwip official webpage: http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/lwip/
 *
 * The actual used lwip is the release 1.3 which you can download from:
 * http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/lwip/
 *
 * \section OpenTCPIP_Configuration Configuration

 * TODO
