 * \page OpenMAKE OpenMAKE Documentation
 *
 * \section OpenMAKE_Directory Directory Three
 *
 * This section explains the Three used for FreeOSEK and all used modules.
 *
 * \subsection OpenMAKE_Directory_Root Root Directory
 *
 * On the root directory of your FreeOSEK instalation you can find the followings directories
 *
 * - out (output files are saved here)
 * - doc (documentation directory)
 * - modulesXX (FreeOSEK modules)
 *
 * and you will find the follogings files:
 *
 * - README (a short introduction)
 * - RELEASENOTES (release notes)
 * - FUTURERELEASES (some description from waht is comming)
 * - Makefile (general makefile)
 *
 * \subsection OpenMAKE_Directory_Module Directory Three
 *
 * Every module (like for example FreeOSEK) has the following directory structure:
 *
 * - FreeOSEK
 *   - etc (configuration files)
 *   - gen (files to be generated)
 *   - src (source files)
 *   - inc (include files)
 *   - mak (make files)
 *
 * \subsection OpenMAKE_Directory_Out Out Directory Three
 *
 * The out directory has the following structure:
 *
 * - out
 *   - doc (generated documentation)
 *   - bin (binary output)
 *   - gen (generated files output)
 *   - lib (libraries)
 *   - obj (object files)
 *
 * \section OpenMAKE_Make Makefiles
 *
 * This section make an introduction to the make files strcture used in FreeOSEK
 *
 * \subsection OpenMAKE_Make_Root General Makefile
 *
 * There is a principal make file which you can find in the root directory of FreeOSEK.

 * In the general Makefile you shall indicate the architecture, indicate the modules you
 * are using, for example if you want to compile the example01 and not the moduletest01
 * you can change the following lines:
 *
 * MODS +=  TestSuite \
 *          FreeOSEK \
 *          moduletest01
 *
 * to:
 *
 * MODS +=  TestSuite \
 *          FreeOSEK \
 *          example01
 *
 * with the option PROJECT=FreeOSEK you can set the name of the binary file.
 *
 * \subsection OpenMAKE_Make_Module Module Makefile
 *
 * There is a make file for every module. You can find the module makefile in the directory mak
 * of the module.
 *
 * Following variables shall be defined on this file, lets take as example the FreeOSEK make file
 *
 * LIB +=  FreeOSEK.a
 *
 * defined the name of the module library name. All objects files of this module will be put
 * together as a library.
 *
 * GEN += genosek
 *
 * indicates which rules are necesary to generate this module, in this case GEN, this rules
 * are going to be executed with "make generate"
 *
 * OPENOSEK_OBJ +=
 *
 * are all object files needed for this module.
 *
 * GENFILES +=
 *
 * indicates all files that have to be generated for this module
 *
 * VPATH +=
 *
 * add all needed paths where make shall search for source files.
 *
 * INCLUDE +=
 *
 * add include directory for search of header files, take in account that allways the directory
 * has to be precceded with -I
 *
 * OpenOSEK.a
 *
 * is the rule to generate the library.
 *
 * genosek:
 *
 * indicates how to generate.
