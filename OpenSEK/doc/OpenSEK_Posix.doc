/**
 * \page OpenSEK_Posix OpenSEK for Poisx
 *
 * OpenSEK uses some posix services to simulate the hardware like interrupts and timers.
 * For the interrupt mechanisms a message queue with signal is used. Every time that you
 * send a message of only one byte to the message queue /dev/mqueue/BINNAME where BINNAME
 * is the binary name of the project defined in the Makefile with the PROJECT variable.
 * As defualt /dev/mqueue/OpenSEK. The received byte in this queue is interprated as an interrupt.
 *
 * \section OpenSEK_Posix_Timers Timers Simulations
 *
 * The POSIX variant has two simulated HW timers which have an interrupt every 10ms. Anyway
 * alarms are not working on the prebeta release.
