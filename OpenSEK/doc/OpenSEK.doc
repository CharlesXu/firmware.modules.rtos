 * \section OpenSEK_Introduction Introduction
 *
 * OpenSEK is an Open Source implementation of the real time operating
 * system specified by OSEK-VDX. The phylosophy of this OS is to provide a
 * syste with standardised interfaces, scalabilty, standard error checkin
 * mechanismus and poritability.
 *
 * \subsection OpenSEK_Introduction_RunLevels Run Levels
 *
 * OpenSEK provides to types of run levels:
 *		- Task level
 *		- ISR level
 *
 * ISR level have allways precedens to task level. Tasks to each other
 * and ISR to each others have precedence with their assigned priorities.
 * Task priorites are signed on configuration time. ISR priorites are
 * assigned per hardware.
 *
 * \subsection OpenSEK_Introduction_ISR ISR Concept
 *
 * OpenSEK provides two types of ISR (interrupt service routines) called
 * ISR1 and ISR2, this means ISR Category 1 and Category 2.
 *
 * ISR1 are transparent for the OS. This means the OS have no control when this
 * types of interrupts are executed, this type of interrupts shall be avoided.
 * No OS interfaces are allowed to be called on ISR1.
 *
 * ISR2 are interrupts which are cached by the OS and the OS call the interrupt
 * code as a function. In this case the stack context is changed and some OS
 * APIs may be called.
 *
 * \subsection OpenSEK_Introduction_Task Task Concept
 *
 * Different as in Windows or Linux on OpenSEK the tasks are defined statically
 * on configuration time. This means that after generating the system and
 * compiling it, no more taks can be added to the system. Is not possibly to
 * create new tasks in a dynamic way.
 *
 * OpenSEK provides two types of tasks:
 * 	- Basic tasks
 * 	- Extended tasks
 *
 * Every task has to be in one of 3 states:
 * 	- \b Running: the task is running, only one task every time can be running
 * 	- \b Read: the task ready and waiting on the execution queue.
 * 	- \b Suspended: the task is stopped.
 *	
 *	Extended tasks have an extra state:
 *		- \b Waiting: the task is waiting for the occurence of one or more events.
 *
 *	Not all convinations of state changes are allowed, here a list of allowed
 *	task state changes:
 *		- \b activate: the task is moved from the suspended state to the ready state
 *		- \b start: the task is moved from the ready state to the running state
 *		- \b wait: the taks is moved from the running state to the waiting state
 *		- \b release: the task is moved from the waiting state to the ready state
 *		- \b preempt: the taks is moved from the running state to the ready state
 *		- \b teminate: the task is moved from the running state to the suspended state
 *
 * State changes wait and release are only allowed to extended tasks.
 *
 * The state changes start, release, and preempt are performed by the
 * scheduler. The user can only indirect influent this changes. For
 * example activating a task whith a higher priority will preemt any lower
 * priority preemtive task. Setting a event of a task waiting for it
 * will release this task
 *
 * \subsubsection OpenSEK_Introduction_Task_Priority Task Priority
 *
 * The Scheduler decides in function of the task priority which is the naxt
 * task to be started. When two tasks have the same priority the tasks which
 * was activated before will be executed.
 *
 * Task priorites are set on configuration time. A higer value represents
 * a higher priority. 
 *
 * The OS has one ready queue for every priority.
 *
 * \subsection OpenSEK_Introduction_Scheduling
 *
 * There are to Scheduling methods which can be set to each task. \b preemtive
 * and \b non \b preemtive.
 *
 * \subsubsection OpenSEK_Introduction_Scheduling_Preemtive Preemtive Tasks
 *
 * \b Preemtive tasks can be preemted (interrrupted) while running and set back in
 * rady state when a higher priority task has been activated.
 *
 * \subsubsection OpenSEK_Introduction_Scheduling_Nonpreemtive Non Preemtive
 * Tasks
 *
 * \b Non \b Preemtive tasks can not be interrupted while running. After the
 * task is to running only the task can decide when it will be finished or
 * preemted. Interrupts may be executed on this time, but not other tasks.
 * This type of tasks have their scene specialy in small tasks where a task
 * context swtich may take so long time as finishing the task.
 *
 * Non Preemtive task may call the Scheduler function to explicit decide points
 * where a preemtion may be possibly.
 *
 * In Non Preemtvie tasks which doesn't call the Scheduler the OS can make some
 * resources optimisation since this task doesn't need a context space to save
 * the registers if a task swtich occurs.
 *
 * \subsection OpenSEK_Introduction_TaskGroup Group of Tasks
 *
 * The user may be interesed to have some types or Non Preemtive task for
 * a group of tasks. This means that some tasks all in a task group  may be
 * non preemtive to each other but may be preemted by task with higher
 * priorities of other groups. Every task can belong to one group.
 *
 * \subsection OpenSEK_Introduction_ApplMode Application Modes
 *
 * OpenSEK can be confiured to have one or more Application Modes. At
 * least one Application Mode has to be defined. For every Application
 * Mode the user can select some tasks and alarms to be started autmaticaly.
 * The user has to take care to select the adequate Application Mode after
 * every reset and call the StartOs OS interfaces indicating the Application
 * Mode.
 *
 * \subsection OpenSEK_Introduction_Events Event Mechanism
 *
 * Events are used in OpenSEK to synconize events and are only allowed for
 * extended tasks.
 *
 * An extended task can clear and wait for his pre configured events. Every
 * task or ISR2 can set events of any task. Is not possible to clear events
 * of other tasks or to wait for events of others tasks.
 *
 * \subsection OpenSEK_Introduction_Resources Resources in OpenSEK
 *
 * Resources are used in OpenSEK to coordinate access of many tasks with
 * different priorities to one resource.
 *
 * The resource mechanism avoid that two tasks get access to a same resorce
 * any time. To avoid this a \b Priority \b Ceiling \b Protocol is used. This
 * protocol avoids the posbility that a task tries to use a resource which
 * is beeing accessed by other task. This avoids protocol avoids deadlocks too.
 *
 * \subsubsection OpenSEK_Introduction_Resources_CeilingProtocol Ceiling Protocol
 *
 * The Ceiling Protocol defines a static priority for every resource. this priority:
 * 	- shall be set to at least the highest priority of all tasks using this
 * 	  resource.
 * 	- shall be lower to the lowest priority of all tasks that do not use this
 * 	  resource and have higher priority to all taks that use the resource.
 *
 * When a task get a resource it priority is set to the resource priority and set
 * back to the original priority when the resource is released.
 *
 * \subsection OpenSEK_Introduction_InternalResources Internal Resources
 *
 * Internal resources are like resources but are not visible to the user. Every
 * task can be assigned maximal to one internal resource. Every time that the
 * task is started the internal resources will be getted and released when the
 * tasks terminates.
 *
 * This allow a task to have two priorites, one on the ready state to decide when
 * the task will be executed and other priority when running, this priority decide
 * when the task will be set back to ready state if preemtion occurs.
 *

 * \section OpenSEK_Arch Dependencies to every platform
 *
 * \subsection OpenSEK_Arch_Posix Posix dependencies
 *
 * OpenSEK uses some posix services to simulate the hardware like interrupts and timers.
 * For the interrupt mechanisms a message queue with signal is used. Every time that you
 * send a message of only one byte to the message queue /dev/mqueue/BINNAME where BINNAME
 * is the binary name of the project defined in the Makefile with the PROJECT variable.
 * As defualt /dev/mqueue/OpenSEK. The received byte in this queue is interprated as an interrupt.
 *
 * \subsubsection OpenSEK_Arch_Posix_Timers Timers Simulations
 *
 * The POSIX variant has two simulated HW timers which have an interrupt every 10ms. Anyway
 * alarms are not working on the prebeta release.
 *
 * \subsection OpenSEK_Windows Windows dependencies
 *
 * If you do not have Linux or any posix compatible system you can run OpenSEK on windows.
 * For this propouse you are going to need cygwin.
 * <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">http://www.cygwin.com/</a>. You can
 * download and get help for the instalation on cygwin page.
 *
 * \subsubsection OpenSEK_Windows_Int Interrupt Simulation on Windows
 *
 * To simulate the interrupts on windows you are going to need to install an extra
 * packet of cywgin called <b>cygrunsrv</b> you can find it in the Admin tools on the
 * cygwin configuration.
 *
 * After installing the packet you have to configure and start the cygserver for the first time,
 * the cygserver is going to take care of the IPC for the interrupts simulations on Windows.
 * you have to run the <b>cygserver-config</b> to create the default configuration.
 *
 * After loading the default configuration you have to run the server with:
 * net start cygserver or stop for stoping.
 *
 * The last thing you have to do is to enable the server so you have to define
 * the environment variable CYGWIN to server.
 *
 * \code
 * export CYGWIN=server
 * \endcode
 *
 * Then you can run OpenSEK on windows. :)
 *
 * \subsubsection OpenSEK_Windows_Stack OpenSEK stack size on Windows
 *
 * The size of the stack of your tasks in windows has to be realtive BIG if
 * you are going to use system calls. I hope we can find a better solution
 * for the next release but at this moment the needed stack is about 50kb.
 * But the problem is not the opensek alos the Cygwin Windows interfaces like
 * usleep and printf.
 *
 * \section OpenSEK_Porting Porting OpenSEK to new platforms
 *
 * This sections explains how to port OpenSEK to a new platform. Important is
 * that you will need a good background of the platform where you want to port
 * OpenSEK and to have access to an evaluation board to test and debug your
 * work.
 *
 * We recommend you to base your work for the new platform on an other
 * platform. If there is a platform which is like yours take this platform
 * but is not the case you can base your work in posix or windows platform.
 * Always is easier to have the files and to change it on the way when
 * you try to compile.
 *
 * \subsection OpenSEK_Porting_DirStructure Directory structure
 *
 * First of all lets take a look on the OpenSEK directory structure. There
 * are some generic directories and other that are platform specific. To port
 * OpenSEK to a new platform you have only to work on the project specific
 * files, you DON'T have to change anything on the generic directories. If
 * you change anything on a generic directory the code may not run any more
 * in an other platform, so please take care of this.
 *
 * Platform specific directories are:
 *
 * - OpenSEK/gen/src/\<ARCH\>
 * - OpenSEK/gen/src/\<ARCH\>/\<CPUTYPE\>
 * - OpenSEK/gen/inc/\<ARCH\>
 * - OpenSEK/gen/inc/\<ARCH\>/\<CPUTYPE\>
 * - OpenSEK/src/\<ARCH\>
 * - OpenSEK/src/\<ARCH\>/\<CPUTYPE\>
 * - OpenSEK/inc/\<ARCH\>
 * - OpenSEK/inc/\<ARCH\>/\<CPUTYPE\>
 * - OpenSEK/mak/\<ARCH\>
 * - OpenSEK/mak/\<ARCH\>/\<CPUTYPE\>
 *
 * Not all directories are needed to all platforms. This depends on how you
 * create the structure for your platform. First of all you have to define
 * an architecture name, for example for Windows (cygwin) we are sugin win and
 * for Linux (posix) posix. Please use a lower case name with only alphabetica
 * letters (a-z).
 *
 * After defining your \<ARCH\> name you have to decide if you need one or more
 * \<CPUTYPEs\>. Some microcontrollers are a main controller with many sub
 * controllers which for example may have less or more timers, i/o channels
 * or any other small HW differences. In the case that there is no appreciable
 * difference you can work only with the \<ARCH\> directories, if you want to
 * make a difference between \<CPUTYPES\> you can define one or more
 * \<CPUTYPEs\>. Again for all \<CPUTYPES\> names use lower cases and only
 * alphabeticals letters (a-z).
 *
 * Important is that all files that you will write generic for all
 * \<CPUTYPEs\> have to be written on the \<ARCH\> directorie and all specific
 * for an \<CPUTYPE\> have to be written on the \<CPUTYPE\> directory.
 *
 * For example if you don't need separated files for \<CPUTYPEs\> you don't
 * have to create any \<CPUTYPE\> directory, same if you don't need any special
 * make file you don't need a OpenSEK/mak/\<ARCH\> or
 * OpenSEK/mak/\<ARCH\>/\<CPUTYPE\>.
 * 
 * \subsection OpenSEK_Porting_Files Files to be ported
 *
 * The following files have to be defined since they are included
 * from the generic files or compiled and linked, and are:
 *
 * - Osek_Arch.h
 * - Osek_Internal_Arch.h
 * - Osek_Internal_Arch_Cfg.h
 * - Osek_Internal_Cfg.h
 * - Osek_Internal_Arch_Cfg.c.php
