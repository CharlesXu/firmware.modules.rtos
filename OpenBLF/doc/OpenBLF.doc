 * \section OpenBLF_Int Introduction to the Boot Loader Flasher
 *
 * The Boot Loader Flasher is a module which takes the control of the uC
 * after every boot and check for some specific preconfigurated conditions
 * to decide to jmp to the normal application or to stay in the Boot Loader
 * Flasher state.
 *
 * This modules allow the end user in case of an error or an update on the
 * application to reflash the software over a standard bus: ethernet, can,
 * spi, usb or like.
 *
 * At this moment nobody is working on this module, but in some time I hope
 * somebody starts working in the BLF for OpenSEK.
