 * OpenGEN is the Generic Module of FreeOSEK. It takes generic tasks like
 * the FreeOSEK generator and generic files like types and memory allocation
 * files.
 *
 * For information related to the FreeOSEK generator take a look on the 
 * follogwing page:
 *
 * \subpage OpenGEN_Generator
 *
 * This page will documents the rest of the OpenGEN features.
 *
 * \section OpenGEN_MA Memory Allocation
 *
 * In embedded systems is sometime important to decide which information or
 * functions are lockated in specific places on the memory. To make this 
 * possibly the OpenGEN modules allow a memory allocation system based on the
 * AUTOSAR standard, at least the idea was taken from this standard.

 * \section OpenGEN_MA_Types Types
 *
 * An important feature of the OpenGEN module are the offered types used
 * for all sub modules. This allow you to use in an easy way a for example
 * an unsigned int with 8 bytes using the type uint8.
 *
 * If you want to use these types you have only to include Types.h. But if
 * you use any other FreeOSEK module you may have this Types being included in
 * your namespace anyway.
 *
 * The defined types are:
 *
 * \copydoc uint8
 * \copydoc sint8
 * \copydoc uint8f
 * \copydoc sint8f
 * \copydoc uint8
 * \copydoc sint16
 * \copydoc uint16f
 * \copydoc sint16f
 * \copydoc uint32
 * \copydoc sint32
 * \copydoc uint32f
 * \copydoc sint32f
 * \copydoc NULL
